			<h1>HCI Labweeks</h1>
			<p>In these two weeks I worked together with my group on our interactive concept in Maakhaven. After those weeks building an interactive installation, we presented it in an exhibition.</p>
			<h4>Process</h4>
			<p id="info">Click on a day to see more information.</p>
				<div class="days"><h2>Day 1: The Startup</h2></div>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>On the first day, we got introduced to the Lab weeks and got to know more about what we will do. Then we split up into our assigned groups and got to know each other and the specific topic that we were working with.</p>
					<h4>Wearables!</h4>
					<p>That’s the topic I did get with my four groupmates. 
					What do we do now? Is what we thought. We were supposed to work based on the scrum method. So, we’ve made a scrum board and asked ourselves what we need to do for day one. We decided to do some brainstorming and mind mapping to come up with an idea to make. We talked about the topic wearables, so what reasons are there, what wearables exist, where can they be used for and on what areas. We talked about our hobbies, experiences with wearables and problems we have on the daily life what we maybe can use. </p>
					<p>We researched what elements we needed if we wanted the idea to come alive. We found out that we needed, for a basic first prototype, an Arduino board, and some sort of Vibration sensor. We got those from our lecturers and started to solder one of the vibration sensors to cables of the Arduino board, so we could later on connect them with the board and therefore the code. After the soldering, we connected it to the board and with the help of some YouTube videos, Alec started coding. But even after trying multiple times, it still wouldn’t work, and we didn’t know why, so we decided to try it with another sensor, which wasn’t soldered and connected it through some jumper cables. To our excitement, this worked and we were very surprised by the strength of the vibration. Since we only had three sensors, one of which with only one cable, we decided to try the soldered one again, by removing it from the Arduino cables. Unfortunately, it still didn’t work, which for us meant that we had to order some ourselves online, to get them the following day. By the end of the day, we had ordered the sensors from TinyTronics, and sat together for a small discussion on what our next steps would be. We decided that we still had to buy some slippers, test all the motors/sensors and get the motors to be controlled by code (change its behaviour). We also needed to ask ourselves the question of how we wanted the product design to be. We ended the meeting with one of the lecturers summing up the day and telling us what we can expect from tomorrow.</p>

					</div>
					<p>We chose the subjects music and festivals, because we all have a connection with this and is fun for everyone. After going deeper on the both topics, we thought about different inputs and outputs and what people can do with it. Finally, we came up with the idea to track the rhythm of a song someone plays on their phone/laptop or another device with Wi-Fi and give impulses by vibrations in someone’s shoes e.g. insoles. In that case people can wear this in festivals, concerts, parties but also at home. Users can feel the rhythm and it gives them an extra dimension.</p>
					<p>To make the vibration work, we had to solder a larger cable as an extension for testing and for connecting it to the Arduino board. The vibration motor can have a maximum of 3 volt and the cables had to be plugged into the ground and one in 3,5. Instead of using digitalWrite in the code we used analogWrite, so that we didn’t had to use the Arduino board but just doing it analogue. The first motor we had just didn’t work what took us some time. We think it was broken because of the soldering. Another one worked with jumper cables. The code we’ve used didn’t influence the vibration. For testing and our end product we need more vibration motors so people can feel it in their whole foot/feet, which we ordered at tiny tronics. </p>

				<div class="days"><h2>Day 2: An efficient day</h2></div>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>At first we did a daily standup. We said what we did yesterday and what our goals were for today. It all was still a bit general. We started cutting three circles in the slippers so the motors can be placed into them. The places we cutted out, are the points where the feet pressure is the highest. The users will feel it there the most and will get the best sensation out of it.</p>

					<p>We let the Arduino code work with the vibration motor. The motor works by using a potmeter and it now vibrates with BPM.

					<p>To connect the vibration with a music song we need a wifiboard. But this board isn’t working with the code yet.</p>
					<p>All the vibration motors came in by post so we now had a total of 10 (we needed 8 but always be sure and order some more). We’ve soldered almost all the wires to the motors.</p>
					<p>Between working on our project there was a guest lecture to provide us from information about projects he did. His name was Vincent and he is the owner of Next Empire: <a>https://nextempire.net/</a>. This company is a product / experience studio with a new purpose whom works for e.g. PostNL and Efteling. They’ve made a 3d sound system with storytelling entertainment for Artis where people gets to hear a story about a ghost which have murdered people and animals. For KPN they created an Augmented Reality installation called You &amp;_AI. Through a playful interaction people can experience the transformation of how people will live and work in the near future. The guest speaker surprised me with the cool projects they’ve made and gave me motivation to build something really nice as well.</p>

				<div class="days"><h2>Day 3: Being productive</h2></div>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>We started the day again with daily standup. I’ve told I would like to do the soldering of the motors to the cables, designing the logo and cutting out the last holes. We also decided to brainstorm together about the productname and we came up at the end with: FlipHop, because the combination of Flipflop and Hiphop, what has to do with music and hop is also like hopping to a different place with the slippers. The other groupmates will figure out how they can plug three motors into one pin.</p>
					<p>In the beginning of the day we’ve had a guest lecture from Dr. Lr. Joost Broekens. He was a teacher and researcher at an university. The whole presentation was about robotica, which we couldn’t really use for our project. But still I have seen some interesting things, for example a (digital) mouse that learns action preferences, so it knows where the food is and that he needs that and knows that it can’t go through the lava. It makes use of the technology reinforcement learning, it learns a lot of trials.
					</p>

					</div>
					<p>We found out other groups all used lights and another group had the same ideas as us. To be original, we decided to change our product. We’ve had a brainstorm session to come up with new ideas and we decided to not work with lights, because almost all the wearable groups were working with it. The ideas we had were:
					-	Instead of ledlights around the sole or on the band we can use lasers or other lights
					-	A GPS in it with also an installation which tells you what way you need to go to get to the place you want to be
					-	A steptracker which tracks the amount of dancepasses you’ve made.
					</p>
					<p>After the guest lecture we worked on the motors and the logo. We thought it is a good idea to make different logos and combinate as far as it can. The slipper you can see in the final logo had three different colours, and the colours are shown on the places where the vibration motors can be found.</p>

					</div>
					<p>During working on the vibration motors (three in one) we found out there was not enough volt what the Arduino board can handle. The Arduino board can handle five volts in total, but each motor needs three. So, we bought a battery with nine volt. The problem is solved, and it worked.</p>

					</div>
					<p>Later on we heard that the vibration motors works as a kind of dynamo and leads energy, even when we put them off they turn further. That’s why the stream of energy goes against the direction of the normal circuit and is harmful for the Arduino Board. With a diode the stream will just go one way, in that way it will only go to the ground and not back into the Arduino board. We needed also a transistor which can be used as a sort of switch and it works on volts. If a high voltage comes in, it will go open and when the voltage goes down it will close. Another new material we will use is a capacitor that works like a buffer for the energy. </p>

				<div class="days"><h2>Day 4: More brainstorming</h2></div>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>The daily start-up just goes by every day and the updates and what we need to do and all will be there in my process. So at this point I will stop saying about what we’ve talked about in the daily startup, but we just do it every day.</p>
					<p>We started the day with a presentation of Teun Verkerk who creates electronic lifeforms and media in public spaces. He thinks about new ways of communication by mixing tangible with digital using compemporary shapes and techniques. This wasn't really interesting for me, I thought it was not really usefull what projects he made.</p>
					<div class="afbeeldingen">
					<figure><img src="styles/day4/guestlecture3.jpg" alt="Guest lecture Verkerk" id="poster" class="afbeeldingen"><figcaption>Guest lecture Teun Verkerk</figcaption></figure>
					</div>
					<p>We had to decide which features we wanted to put in. So we first had a brainstorm session for this. You can find the picture below. We decided to make connected flipflops with your friend, and when you don’t know what the location is of your friend, you can use the slippers to get closer to him. It is like the warmer/colder game. The flipflops let you know when you are getting closer to your friend. We will add lights to the bands of the slippers to show this, but also the motors will vibrate stronger/more when you get closer.</p>

					<figure><img src="styles/day4/problems.jpg" alt="Problems we can get" id="afbeeldingen" class="afbeeldingen"><figcaption>Problems we can get</figcaption></figure>
					</div>
					<p>I thought that it also would be nice to make a visualisation in 3d (by sketches it and not actually printing it) of the flipflops to have a better vision of it and to show in at the expo. I started making these, but we’re not sure yet what materials we are going to use to make this all work and how this will look like.</p>
					<p>We've made the new circuit to work with the new transistor and capacitor. To make the circuit better, we have to use the wifiboard. We also needed to test the slippers if the vibration was good enough. We've made the conclusion that we did feel the vibration, but not really strong. We want to change that by using another transistor.</p>

				<div class="days"><h2>Day 5: Make it light up</h2></div>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>We began with the last guest lecture of those weeks. Marcello gave us some information about playful interactions. His presentation was a surprise, he did an interactive presentation by asking questions to the public. Unfortunately, it was the last presentation and we realised no one showed up with the topic wearables.</p>

					</div>
					<p>To go further with our project, we had to buy a colour led strip and two Bluetooth sensors. The colour led strip functionate as an output to show the user that he is nearby his friend. Our idea is that the colours will blink faster when you are nearby the user, so the real party is on! And when you are further away from your friend the lights will still blink, but a bit slower. The vibration motors also respond on the distance between you and your friend, then you don’t have to look down all the time. By pressing a button you can put this function off, so your feet don’t vibrate all the time (or you have to like this; then you can order your slippers with us with all-time vibration ;) ). Me and Sophia started with a circuit for the led lights and stripping it, because we don’t use the additional USB connection.</p>

					</div>
					<p>Daniel and Alec worked with the two Bluetooth sensors. We wanted to see the values between two objects, so we can implement that in the different pair of slippers. By the end of the day, a Bluetooth sensor worked with a connection with my Iphone and you can see how long the distance is between them. Here is a video working with the Bluetooth sensors:</p>

					</div>
					<p>During this day we also went to the thrift shop, where we wanted to buy a mannequin what will be ‘the friend’ on the expo. But after there were complaints from a group member about the money (around €5 each for the mannequin) and the questioning about how much we need it, we didn’t buy it. We wanted to have a group mentality and buy everything together if we are going to use it. Next time we would like to hear it immediately if someone don’t want something so we can figure it out. We decided as a group to let each other know the next time. We’ve tried to think about alternatives, such as paper mâché, using a real person or drawing a person. But with them all there were too many disadvantages (money, time etc.), we have to brainstorm more about this..</p>
					<p>We’ve made a good progress today and hope we will make some big steps coming days, because we only have three days before it needs to be finished.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="days"><h2>Day 6: It's time for fun</h2></div>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>We first went to the shops and searched online where we bought:
					-	Slippers with one band so we can implement the bluetooth board etc. better
					-	A blow-up doll for expo presentation
					-	Coloured tape for expo presentation
					-	Festive/party things for expo presentation
					The distance affects the vibration intensity now. Sophia and I made the music sensor work. You can see that in the video below. At the end of the day we’ve decided to first focus on the part of ‘find your friend’s’ with lights and vibration and let go of the idea of feeling the music through it. We first have to make one of these work into the details before starting with something else, it is important to have one thing work.</p>

				<div class="days"><h2>Day 7: Last things... I thought</h2></div>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>I soldered this morning a lot with Daniël. Alec have made the Bluetooth board work with the distance en the code running on the laptop without having a connection with the laptop. It uses the bluetooth of a phone.
					Jeroen tried to make the visualisation of the slippers and we together made an informative presentation poster. We also had to cut the holes for the wires. Sophia thought about the presentation for the expo.</p>
					<div class="afbeeldingen">

				</div>

				<div class="days"><h2>Day 8: Only one day before the Expo!</h2></div>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>Started the day with soldering all the wires with Daniel. Alec kept going on with the Bluetooth board, which resulted to a working Bluetooth board and working with the code. It remembers what the board needs to do; make the vibration motor work and reacts to the amount of distance there is inbetween. Only the vibration is a bit weak, we are trying to make that stronger.
					Turn on at 10k voltage, it isn’t really high restitant and the resistors we have.
					We now included the lightning into the circuit of the Bluetooth connection. When someone is going further away, then the lights are dimming. It is not going fluently yet.

				<div class="days"><h2>Day 9: LAST DAY</h2></div>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>The last day was so stressfull! The portable chargers didn't work with the arduino board because of a safety lock. We had to buy last-minute two special Arduino batteries and gladly they did work. But then we had to do the soldering very quick. </p>
					<p>
					Everyone did bring some festival stuff to hang on during the Expo, for the real party/summer vibes. The slippers didn't look as good as I wanted, but they worked till the end and that is what matters.
					</p>
					<div class="afbeeldingen">

				<h4>Our product: Fliphop</h1>
				<p>Our concept revolves around the feel-good festival experience. In order for you to share those amazing memories with your friends, the slippers will help you to never lose them completely.  The idea is to bring people together with a proximity device that vibrates stronger or softer depending on the distance between you and your friend. The LED lights and vibration motors will tell you how far away you are from your friends.
				</p>
				<p>The flip flops will be equipped with LED lights, vibrating motors and a location based system. The two available settings are “find my friends” or simply “off”. The location based system will help you to find out if and how close you are to your friend, by indicating the proximity through LED lights and the vibrating sensors. The vibrating motors will help to determine the location without having to look down when you can’t while the LED lights will be more precise and easy to read. The product can be used in several ways. Not only can it help you find the general direction of your friends when you lose them, it can also aid in pinpointing them when you know their approximate location.</p>
